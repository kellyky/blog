# Blog
This is currently an unstyled, generic and otherwise empty blog app, I created following the [Rails Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) tutorial. 

## Technologies Used
* Ruby
* Rails

## Prerequisits
I think the prerequisits to run the blog are the same as for rails. From the Rails Guide:
* Ruby 2.5 or later
* SQLite3
* Node.js 8.16 or later
* Yarn

## Setup/Installation
To use this app for your own local blog:
1. Clone this repo
2. Change the current (placeholder) username/password in app/controllers/articles_controller.rb and app/controllers/comments_controller.rb
4. From the top level of this directory, run `bin/rails server` in the terminal
5. In your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000
6. Blog away, within the confines of your local machine

## Issues
Login/password are coded/no set password at this point. 

Otherwise it works, but it's empty. No content. It's not styled. Not yet anyways.
